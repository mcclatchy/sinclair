Sinclair v2 takes a different approach to special projects. Instead of building external pages largely reliant on JavaScript, this version provides a process and snippets that can be used inside of the current publishing system. This approach provides the following benefits:

1. A smaller impact to the regular workflow.
2. A better search engine ranking.
3. Better social media integration.
4. It does not affect Omniture data.
5. It does not affect reporter data.
6. It reduces development costs.
7. Stories can be shared between markets.
